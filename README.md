##  F.A.Q :thinking:
**Why the script opens firefox?**

The opening of firefox is just used for scraping you can find more info on this on google:selenium-webdriver

**The script made my system lag or crashed**

This will only happen if you forcefully close the script during scraping i:e: the created instance wont be closed
as you forcefully closed the script, the closed signal wont be given by the script to its running instances thats why
always use 'exit' to close.
